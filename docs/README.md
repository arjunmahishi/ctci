# idleserver
Idle-busy server
-----------------

You have a server and your server usually has busy periods and idle periods. From the server logs you have created a list of intervals during which the server was busy.
Unfortunately, you realise that this list is not accurate and you had missed some intervals. Write code to merge these new intervalsInput

Existing Intervals [1, 2] [4, 7]  [11, 13] [15, 21]
Missing Intervals [3, 4]  [5,12] [23, 25]
Merged Output [1, 2] [3,13] [15, 21] [23, 25]

# triplet
## Problem

Given a sorted array of positive integers.
All numbers in the array exist as pairs.
But there is exactly one number that appears as a triplet.

Find the triplet!


# watercapacity
## Problem

Given an array, print how many units of water it can hold. array representing hight of walls

1 0 1 can hold 1 unit of water
3 1 0 2 can hold 3 units of water
3 2 1 cannot hold any water so the answer is 0



Sample test cases:

5 1 2 1 3 3 4 --> 10
7 4 3 3 2 1 1 --> 0
3 7 3 1 4 8 2 --> 13
9 2 5 2 1 4 8 --> 26
